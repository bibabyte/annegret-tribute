 	     <p>In 1912 Anna Margrette Erhardt was born to Carl Ehrardt (1880-1940) and Viktoria Ehrhardt nee: Brandrup (1885-1966).</p>
 	     <p> When she was a few months old her father recieved a position working as a Theater Technician for a Grand Duke of Russia. The young family thought their prospects were good, but the outbreak of World War I was soon to change their plans.</p>

      <p>On July 28 1914 the Ehrhardt family was on vacaiton visiting Viktoria's family in Zullichau. When Archduke Franz Ferdinand was killed and World War I broke out the family only had two suitcases of vacation clothes with them, and they did not return to Russia to work or to collect their posessions.</p>
      <p>Annegret, her pregnant mother, and her father were now homeless and jobless. The family stayed on in Zullichau for a while, but Carl was soon drafted in the war, and Viktoria took Annegret and her new baby sister <em>Karina</em> to live with her maternal grandfather Arthur Brandrup (1851 - 1927).</p>

      <p>Annegret fondly remembered living at her great grandfather's home in Hartau (a small town on the boarder of Germany and Czech Republic) during the war. By all accounts the patriarch, Franz Cypers von Landrecy (1820-1921), was a strict man and little, serious Annegret had his heart.</p>
      <p>Where her mother and sister were fun-loving and free-spirited "butterflies" Annegret found comfort and kindness in her gruff great-grandfather who would tell her sad and romantic tales after dinner.</p>
      <p>They had a comfortable life, there were strict rules to follow, but if adhered to things were well. Despite their father being absent in the war the children and their mother enjoyed a relaxed lifestyle of leisure often playing and painting the local landscape.</p>

      <p>After the war Carl looked for work. In 1921 the family moved to ___ where he had finally found some. Their life changed drastically from one of luxury and nature to a modest apartment in the city.</p>
      <p>Carl Ehrhardt likly suffered from PTSD and depression, Annegret said that it was hard to connect with him after the war. The burden of taking care of the family fell square on his shoulders as Viktoria was a happy butterfly who adapted to whatever situation she found herself in. Annegret seemed to think that Carl felt alone in his role and wished for more of a partner in his wife, stating also that Viktoria was more of a playmate than a mother to her children.</p>
      <p>Carl struggled in various jobs and was not met with great success, though he and Annegret were able to create a stronger bond as she became older and was able to see the weight of responsibility he carried. He died of a heart-attack in 1940.</p>
      <p>In her 80s Annegret would reflect that she was glad he passed away quickly and didn't have to experience World War II. She added that one friend of his was killed in action after being drafted into the military at age 60.</p>

      <p>Annegret studied at university under the Nazi regime, she would complain that shhe wanted to study art but it wasn't allowed as it wouldn't further the Reich. </p>
      <p>While visiting a bookstore near campus she saw a young man reading an art history book and was smitten. She approached him and discovered that he was buying the book for his sister, and asked if he needed help packaging the book to ship it. He accepted and the first connection was cemented between them. His name was Otto Braun</p>
      <p>Through the war the two of them would send eachother messages though the mail system was fractured. Information is scarse about Annegrets time during the war. Otto was conscripted and at some point was taken as a prisoner of war where he remained until US troops released him after the armistice.</p>

    <div class='content'>
      <p>Somehow Annegret and Otto found eachother after the war. Annegret was in what would soon become East Germany when they came back together. The story goes that Annegret forged documents for Otto saying he was a hairdresser to make their crossing the boarder into US controlled territory easier as his official paperwork listed him as an engineer and they were concerned the Soviets would not let them cross.</p>
      <p>They had no home, no income, living in a broken country. Annegrets mother was living with a relative in Bad Heilbrun, in Bavaria, and the two went to ask her for her blessing for them to marry. The story goes: Viktoria said that if they stocked the cellar with wood and procured a new stovepipe for the house they could marry and live there.</p>
      <p>There are pictures still of the newly-weds at the edge of a forrest resting while bringing in firewood for the winter.</p>
      <p>Annegret carried two children to full term, the first was a stillborn girl shortly after the two married. Doctors told Annegret not to try again as she was already over 30 and in his oppinion her malnourished body would not be able to carry a child. Despite the warnings Annegret gave birth to Stephan Andreas Braun on February 11 1951. She was 39 years old.</p>

    <div class='content'>
      <p>Andreas, as Annegret's son was known, was born in Bad Toelz, the 'big city' compared to Bad Heilbrun where his parents lived. Like his mother he was raised in the country for his early years, though the family lived in a small cottage.</p> 
      <p>In 1957 the family bought a home on the outskirts of Munich where Annegret and Otto would live until their final years. By the time Annegret and Otto moved out of that home the city of Munich had grown up around them.</p>
      <p>Andreas was often sick and Annegret spent much time taking care of him and watching over him at the hospital. Otto was often away on business, in that way too the childhoods of Annegret and Andreas were similar.</p>
      <p>Andreas did not follow his familial footsteps into a career in engineering. After leaving school he traveled a lot ending up in India where he found a teacher who he would follow for the rest of his life. While we don't know what Annegret and Otto thought about his strange behavior and dress, we do know that they continued to see eachother, Annegret and Otto traveling far and wide to spend time with their son.</p>

    <div class='content'>
      <p>By 1973 Annegret and Otto had finished raising their son and now spent time focusing on themselves and eachother. They had many friends who were artists and musicians and took up traveling and art themselves.</p>
      <p>Andreas had seemed to settle in a small town in Florida and Annegret and Otto built a house nearby so they could visit in comfort.</p>

    <div class='content'>
      <p>In 1988, when in Florida on a visit to their son, their first grandchild was born. While the couple continued to live in Germany and live their happy retired life, they often visited Florida and spent time with their Grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Annegret was a kind grandmother, who often told stories of her own childhood. She shared her favorite recipes and played with the children.</p>
      <p>Annegret died at the age of 96 in an assisted living facility. She had a life, and now she is dead. She will soon be forgotten like the scores of humans who came before.</p>
